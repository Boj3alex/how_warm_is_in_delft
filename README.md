# how_warm_is_in_delft

This little project retrieves from the Internet the current temperature in Delft and prints it to standard output, rounded to degrees Celsius.
The information are obtained from http://www.weerindelft.nl/

The code will be run then in a Docker container which can be integrated into a gitlab pipeline.
